# Calculate!

## Learning Objectives:

- Define 'behaviour' as 'the things a program does'
- Define 'class' as a 'convenient encapsulation of behaviour'
- Encapsulate behaviour into classes

## Overview

* The coach will build a very simple calculator without using classes.
* You'll use classes to encapsulate the calculator code.

## Calculator user stories

```
As a mathematician
So I can add numbers
I want to add two numbers on my calc
```

```
As a mathematician
So I can subtract
I want to subtract two numbers on my calc
```

```
As mathematician
So I can enjoy the output of the calculator
I want a pretty output
```

## Instructions

1. Clone the starter repository using `git clone <repo url>`.
1. Install any project dependencies using `bundle install`.

> You may have to run `gem install bundler` to install Bundler first.

1. Wrap common behaviour into a class structure. That is; encapsulate common functionality within classes.

### Possible extension

Add a comment at the top of a class definition file saying what the responsibility of the class is. Stick to the following rules: the comment must start with 'understands', it must not reference itself (i.e. a calculator could not 'understands doing calculations' or 'understands being a calculator'), and it should reference the behaviour of the object, not its state.
