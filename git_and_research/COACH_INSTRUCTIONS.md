# Use Git to collaborate on code (and research the things you don't know how to do) (1 hour)

## Starter (10 minutes)

* Talk about the [goal of the course](README.md#goal-of-the-course).

* Do "thumbs" on the [learning objectives](README.md#learning-objectives).

* Talk about how learning is at least 60% of a junior dev's job.

* Remind students they will be pairing and they should work together using the driver/navigator pattern.

* Do a thought shower to gather research techniques from the group.

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

### Note on "thumbs"

This is likely the first time students have used the "thumbs" indicator to check their understanding. If so, explain that:

* "thumbs" is an opportunity for them to assess their own understanding of the learning objectives

* Anything less than a thumbs up is an indication to them that this is an area to investigate further

* "thumbs" is used as an indicator of whether the workshop has covered the learning objectives, but this is not it's primary purpose.

## Main (30 minutes)

* Ask the students to collaborate on a Git repo.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* What research techniques did you use?

* What percentage of your time did you spend researching?

* How did it feel to do research in a pair?

* Do "thumbs" on the learning objectives.

[No PLENARY.md because there's not really much material besides the questions above.]
