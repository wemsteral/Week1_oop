# Use Git to collaborate on code (and research the things you don't know how to do) (1 hour)

## The goal of the course

* Learn to learn.

## Learning objectives

1. Describe researching information as an important skill for a junior developer.
2. Explain how you go about researching a technical topic.
3. Collaborate on a Git repository, researching the things you don't know how to do.

## Collaborate on a Git repository; research the things you don't know how to do (30 mins)

1. Find your pair.  You'll work together.

2. You're going to collaborate on a document that lists your meals.  One of you is Alice. The other is Bob.

3. Alice and Bob. Setup the global Git config on your computer:
  * Set the email address to match the email on your GitHub account.
  * Set the name to your real name.

4. Alice, on your computer, create a `meals` Git repository.  Create a file called `breakfast.txt`.  Add what you had for breakfast today.  Commit your changes.

5. Alice, create a `meals` repository on GitHub. Push your local changes to the GitHub repository.

6. Alice, add Bob as a collaborator on your `meals` GitHub repository.

7. Bob, on your computer, clone (don't fork) Alice's `meals` repository.  Add and commit what you had for breakfast to `breakfast.txt`.  Push your changes to Alice's `meals` repository on GitHub.

8. Alice and Bob, check you have a green contribution square for today on your GitHub profile page.  (Bob needs to accept the collaboration invitation for his contribution to count.)

9. It's now the next day.  Bob is working with a new pair partner.  Bob and his new pair partner want to pick up where Bob and Alice left off the day before.

10. Bob, create a new `meals-2` repo on your GitHub account.

11. Bob, change your local repository remote to point at your new `meals-2` repository.

12. Bob, add what you plan to have for breakfast tomorrow and commit.  Push your changes to your new `meals-2` repo.

13. Bob, check your new commit is listed in the contributions on your GitHub profile page.

### Fun extra stuff if you finish

1. Create a branch.  Make a change and commit it to the branch.  Push the branch to your `meals-2` repo on GitHub.

2. Merge the branch into master.  Push your `master` changes the repo on GitHub.

## Plenary (15 mins)

We'll discuss the collaboration process, and the research process.
